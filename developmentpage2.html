    <h1>Task 1: Text Adventure Game</h1>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>Me and my group have started a Text Adventure Game project in Digital Technology. My group is coding the scenarios in the game with different outcomes as it progresses.</p>
    <img src="Overview2.PNG" class="overviewimages">
    <p>The areaChoice is a variable needed for the code to work. When the user inputs his choice which is either the cave or forest. When the player chooses, the code will store the choice and brings them to its designated function, and should run as it should be.  </p>
    <img src="moreoverview.PNG" class="overviewimages">
    <p>When the player doesn't choose either of the two choices, the else code will run. The code will not proceed unless the user chooses either the cave or forest.</p>

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <h3>What do you like about the scenarios?</h3>
    <p>"The scenarios are good I had chance to win but the game has potential to be good."</p>
    <p>"I love the hat and very cool body.</p>
    <h3>What don't you like about the scenarios?</h3>
    <p>"I think the scenarios should be a bit developed so you can fight with many monsters."</p>
    <p>"The shoulder is little bit blocky. Hoever, if it is a style, it's great."</p>

    <img src="Hat.PNG">
    <p>The hat was circular in the turn around sheet. So I made it more blocky so it'll fit with the character's theme.</p>
    <img src="Top.PNG">
    <p>I made the shoulder broader by resizing the vertice that comprises of the shoulder. The shoulders are more broader now compared to the drawing in my turn around sheet.</p>
