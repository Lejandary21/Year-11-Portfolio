<h1>Overview</h1>
<h3>The design of the character that I would be thinking of is a 3D low poly design of a human, gender depends on the user as it will have a selection for them. The character would have the Jujutsu Tech school uniform. The character would have an average build and height.</h3>

<section id="endusers">
<h1> End Users</h1>
<h3>The end users that I'm expecting are either Jujutsu Kaisen fans or Pokemon fans. The game I'm expecting is a fusion of the two. The age requirement for this game is 15 years old and above as the game might contain graphic content, anyone is free to try the game too. I will keep game in English first so English speakers can only play the game at the moment.</h3>

<h1>Implications</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
    <h3>Aesthetics is the visual representation of a character. Aesthetics is important for a character since It determines what the viewer thinks or feels about the character just based from the appearance of it. </h3>
    </li>
    <li>I addressed this by:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The aesthetics that I've planned for the game is to have a dark environment. The animations would be 2d sort of similar to Generation 5 Pokemon animations to give it some sort of life and match with it's polygon-esk style of the game.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h1>Fuctionality</h1>
    <h3>Functionality is the quality of something to be useful and practical for the purpose for which something was made. This is relevant to my character since it's going to be a low poly character, simple design simple mechanics. </h3>
    </li>
    <li>I addressed this by:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The character should have a cartoony-esk animation style instead of fluid movements to match with the appearance of the character. By this, it will ensure it being functional and simple to use.</li>
    </ul>
