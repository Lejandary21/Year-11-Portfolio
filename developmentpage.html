    <h1>Task 1: Main Body</h1>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>The torso started off as a cube. Then I cut the cube in half and duplicated the same side for the modelling to happen. I put 3 cuts then I editted the corners or vertices to shapen the torso. Unfortunately, I did not screenshot any of the progress or steps I've taken to create the torso.</p>

    <p>I made the waist not too slim not too wide, so it fits with the blocky theme of the character. The lower part contains 2 vertices which allows me to shapen the waist.</p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>The torso in different angles. It's blocky but not too blocky that it looks like a rectangle.</p>

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <h3>What do you like about the character?</h3>
    <p>"I like how simplistic and blocky it is."</p>
    <p>"I love the hat and very cool body.</p>
    <h3>What don't you like about the character?</h3>
    <p>"I don't like how the hat doesn't match with the blocky theme of the rest of the body"</p>
    <p>"The shoulder is little bit blocky. Hoever, if it is a style, it's great."</p>

    <img src="Hat.PNG">
    <p>The hat was circular in the turn around sheet. So I made it more blocky so it'll fit with the character's theme.</p>
    <img src="Top.PNG">
    <p>I made the shoulder broader by resizing the vertice that comprises of the shoulder. The shoulders are more broader now compared to the drawing in my turn around sheet.</p>
